<h5>Core Module in Nodejs </h5>
<ui>
  <li>What are the core modules ?</li>
  <p>Core modules are modules built into Node.js that can be loaded with the require() function without the need for an additional installation. These modules provide fundamental functionality to Node.js, such as file system I/O, networking, and cryptography. Some of the core modules include fs (file system), http (networking), crypto (cryptography), and os (operating system).</p>

  <li>What are the core modules ?</li>
  <li>Node.js comes with several built-in modules also known as core modules that provide developers a set of functionalities to work with. </li>
    <li>thses are inbuit core module in the  node modules </li>
  <p>http - This module provides a way to create HTTP server and client to interact with HTTP resources.

fs - This module provides APIs to interact with the file system. It enables reading, writing, and manipulating files on the file system.

path - This module provides a way to handle and manipulate file paths, including directory and filename operations.

os - This module provides information about the operating system such as the computer's hostname, the type of operating system, the amount of free memory available, etc.

events - This module provides a way to handle and emit events in Node.js applications.

util - This module provides various utility functions that can be used to perform common tasks, such as event handling, debugging, etc.

crypto - This module provides cryptographic and hashing functions to safely hash passwords and other sensitive information.

stream - This module provides a way to read or write data to a stream. It enables the creation of custom streams for communication between different parts of an application.

These are just a few of the core modules available in Node.js. Each of them provides a set of functionalities to perform specific tasks, making Node.js a versatile and efficient platform for development.</p>

    <li>What are global modules? </li>
  <p>Global modules are Node.js modules that are installed globally on your system rather than locally in a specific project's node_modules directory. Global modules can be accessed from anywhere on your system and can be useful for command line tools or utilities that you want to be able to use from anywhere.</p>
  <p>we use the http module to create a server, specify the status code and content type for the response, and send the response body. We then start the server and listen on port 3000.

It's worth noting that Core modules are built into Node.js and have no external dependencies, so they're usually faster than third-party modules.(code is in index.js file)</p>
